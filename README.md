# jailbreakfinalproject
For my final project I had orignally wanted to experiemnt with pygame but quicly realised it was a little out of my comfort zone. I was having a hard time getting used to its capabilities and decided to go for a much safer route using turtle like we've done all year. Even with turtle I face some challenges regarding how to postion everything and get the right dimensions. I did cite the sources I used to help me along the way. Overall, I wish I could've done more but for now it was fun to see what I could do, even if it was simple.

The following video just shows the basics behind my code as well as what it looks like when I run it, enjoy!
